🧩 Prompt to Create the Digital Elderly Assistant App (on Replit)
Create a web application called Digital Elderly Assistant that is gentle, simple, and accessible for elderly users. The app should have a clean UI with large buttons, easy navigation, and minimal clutter. It should include the following features:

🛠️ Core Features:
1. 📝 Task & Reminder Upload:
Allow users to upload tasks (e.g., doctor appointments, daily chores) and medicine schedules.

Support input through text forms and optionally voice input (use Web Speech API or any browser-compatible package).

Users can set:

Title of the task/medicine

Description

Frequency (once, daily, weekly)

Time (e.g., “9:00 AM”)

2. 🔔 Scheduled Notifications:
Use a scheduler (setInterval in frontend or Python’s schedule module if backend exists) to send real-time alerts to the user.

Display a soft pop-up or play a gentle sound when it’s time.

If a reminder is missed, display an option like “Remind me again in 10 minutes.”

3. 💬 Memory Board:
A section where the assistant stores important notes or personal mentions from the user.

Show messages like: “You mentioned you enjoy gardening. Don’t forget to water your plants today.”

4. 🌤️ Mood & Companion Mode:
Add a companion mode: A chatbot that offers kind conversations or reads motivational quotes aloud.

Bonus: Let it detect sad or anxious keywords and respond warmly.

Optional: Connect to calming features like nature sounds or soft music.

5. 🧠 Settings for Caregivers:
Add a protected section where caregivers can:

View tasks & history

Add/edit reminders for the user

Get notifications if a reminder is consistently ignored

6. 📱 Responsive Design:
UI should be mobile-friendly with large fonts, high contrast, and screen reader support.

✅ Tech Stack Recommendation:
Frontend: HTML + TailwindCSS / Bootstrap + JavaScript (or React if you're comfortable)

Backend (optional): Python Flask or Node.js

Notifications: Browser-based (Notification API) or local storage-based

Storage: Use localStorage for prototype, upgrade to Firebase or SQLite later
